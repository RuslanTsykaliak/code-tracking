# The main goal of this application: Make you better than you were before you found this application. (Why?)

## Combining Journaling and Socializing with AI.
I have understand that making daily posts don't provide much results. Which opens me to new perspectice. Do I really know how to make successful post on LinkedIn? Looks like No! This is the most limiting factor of the success of this app idea of transforming journal entries into posts. I don't know what should be taking from journal for a great post! I know how to write journal from my personal experience of more than 10 years journaling, however, I have little to no experience in making LinkedIn posts.

I can provide it with more data like making posts once a week from weekly entry, however, it would just provide more data from which I still don't know what elements should be selected.

## Personal goal. I want to start thinking in a way a system works, close to Software Architector. The ability to speak in the language of the system I am working with and explain code from perspective of that system and not just what the code does on itself. (Why?)

## Testing
1. Run npm run test
2. create a list of all test that are failing and provide me with that list. example list:
test_dir/test1
test_dir/test2
...
tests/promptInputSection.test.tsx tests/integration.promptTemplate.test.tsx tests/saveDraft.test.tsx tests/userGoals.test.tsx tests/components/auth/authForm.test.tsx
3. Analyzize faling test one at a time.
4. Then analyze the files that being tested.
5. Answer the question: Why the test is failing?
6. Provide the plan to fix the test.
7. Implement the plan.
8. run npm run test again and repead proccess untill all tests are passed.


Exit Note:
I have design task: Change button generate post to log in and generate post.

What steps:
1. Analyze the log in logic
2. analyze app/page.tsx
3. analyze @promptInputSection.test.tsx 
4. Create for a user a ne button between Generate Post Prompt and Customize Prompt. The button name "Log in and generate a post"
5. when user click on that button they moved to login page and when they log in they can use generate post button for auth users (you don't need to add anything for auth users)
6. The "Log in and generate a post" should be visible only for non-auth users.
