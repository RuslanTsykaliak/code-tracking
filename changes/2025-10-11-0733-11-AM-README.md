## Architecture

JourIn is built on a modern web architecture that separates the frontend and backend concerns while leveraging the power of Next.js.

*   **Client-Side:** The frontend is built with React and Next.js, providing a fast and interactive user experience. It uses React Hooks and the Context API for state management. For guest users, all data is persisted in the browser's `localStorage`.
*   **Server-Side:** The backend is powered by Next.js API Routes, which provide a serverless environment for handling API requests. This is where the application interacts with the database via Prisma and communicates with the Groq API for AI-powered content generation.
