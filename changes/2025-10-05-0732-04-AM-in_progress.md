## Combining Journaling and Socializing with AI.
I have understand that making daily posts don't provide much results. Which opens me to new perspectice. Do I really know how to make successful post on LinkedIn? Looks like No! This is the most limiting factor of the success of this app idea of transforming journal entries into posts. I don't know what should be taking from journal for a great post! I know how to write journal from my personal experience of more than 10 years journaling, however, I have little to no experience in making LinkedIn posts.

I can provide it with more data like making posts once a week from weekly entry, however, it would just provide more data from which I still don't know what elements should be selected.

## Personal goal. I want to start thinking in a way a system works, close to Software Architector. The ability to speak in the language of the system I am working with and explain code from perspective of that system and not just what the code does on itself. (Why?)

Ability to remove/clear history.


Can you make the text entries to be passed to journalHistorySection.tsx as it done with generetePostPrompt?

For this we will need to create a new componente and when displayed a journal entries create from GeneretePost it should have a button Copy Post instead of Copy Prompt

Is not it possible just pass the data when user click generate post then take the data from generatedPostDisplayDB and text entries, past them to new component for displaying journal entries in the same way as it done for generate post prompt with the only diffrence that the copy prompt button should be replaced with copy post button and the button copy text should be as it is.

How data is being passed to journal history from generate post prompt?
1. PromptInputSection.tsx (the form)
- gathers all the text and calls a function to pass all that data upward.
2. app/page.tsx (the parent component)
- renders the PromptInputSection and passes it the handlePromptGenerate function.
3. journalHistorySection.tsx (the display)

What is my LinkedIn posting strategy?


-----------------------
The "Robust" In-App System
This idea involves building a complete, in-app system for storing, reviewing, and editing data. While powerful, it's significantly more complex.

Cons:

Increased Development Time: You would need to build a full back-end with a database (like Prisma with your existing setup), create API routes for data retrieval and updates, and design complex front-end components for weekly views and in-line editing.

Higher Risk: More complexity means more potential for bugs and a longer development cycle, which could delay your other deadlines.
