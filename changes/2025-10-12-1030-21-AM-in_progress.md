# The main goal of this application: Make you better than you were before you found this application. (Why?)

## Combining Journaling and Socializing with AI.
I have understand that making daily posts don't provide much results. Which opens me to new perspectice. Do I really know how to make successful post on LinkedIn? Looks like No! This is the most limiting factor of the success of this app idea of transforming journal entries into posts. I don't know what should be taking from journal for a great post! I know how to write journal from my personal experience of more than 10 years journaling, however, I have little to no experience in making LinkedIn posts.

I can provide it with more data like making posts once a week from weekly entry, however, it would just provide more data from which I still don't know what elements should be selected.

## Personal goal. I want to start thinking in a way a system works, close to Software Architector. The ability to speak in the language of the system I am working with and explain code from perspective of that system and not just what the code does on itself. (Why?)

## Testing
1. Run npm run test
2. create a list of all test that are failing and provide me with that list. example list:
test_dir/test1
test_dir/test2
...
3. Analyzize faling test one at a time.
4. Then analyze the files that being tested.
5. Answer the question: Why the test is failing?
6. Provide the plan to fix the test.
7. Implement the plan.
8. run npm run test again and repead proccess untill all tests are passed.


# Exit Note:


User Story 1.
I want to fill up multiple reflection lines, like did I go to the Gym, with whom I talk, how I feel, etc. However, I found after adding multiple lines it become hard to scrolle down and to the top of the app and now I conser how to make the ability to reflect on multiple things easy for use.

Propose solution
Ability to move higher or lover fileds for entering data

Thoghts:
1. Drag-and-Drop Handles a good idea.
2. not necessarily as my app https://jour-in.vercel.app/ provides you with ability to make text areay bigger and smaller, in the smalest version it will be title (1 line) and text (1 line) wich total of two lines makeing it one line wouldn't add value.
3. Optimizing field input a great idea, however, it will require multiple  user stories and not one story, as the whole system should of my journaling application https://jour-in.vercel.app/ should be rebuild. At the moment it made to handle cases with text entries and introduction of toggle switch or checkbox or emoji selecto or rating/slider (1-10) will make core changes to other blocks of the app. Still, I like this idea as the direction for better user experience.
4. Reduntant as you can use bar on the side to move from down to top or from top to down.

Final:
Drag-and-Drop Reordering
This feature focuses on empowering the user to prioritize their most important reflection points, minimizing daily scrolling.

Story ID 1	Feature	User Story
UL-DR-1	Reorder Fields within a page	As a user customizing my reflection layout, I want to drag and drop individual reflection fields within a page, so that I can ensure the most relevant questions appear first.

Implementation Plan:

To implement the drag-and-drop functionality, I will use the dnd-kit library, which is a modern and powerful drag-and-drop toolkit for React.

1. Install dnd-kit: Add @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable, and @dnd-kit/utilities to the project dependencies.
