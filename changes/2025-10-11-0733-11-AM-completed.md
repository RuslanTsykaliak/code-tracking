now how to fix this issue:

Error generating post: Error: 400 {"error":{"message":"The model `llama3-8b-8192` has been decommissioned and is no longer supported. Please refer to https://console.groq.com/docs/deprecations for a recommendation on which model to use instead.","type":"invalid_request_error","code":"model_decommissioned"}}

API
A new file for displaying the prompt output when you use AI
API to send a prompt to it to generalte reposnes.

app/api/generate/route.ts 
app/api/generate/db/route.ts

app/components/generatePostPromptButton.tsx
app/components/generatePostPromptButtonDB.tsx
app/components/generatedPostDisplayDB.tsx
app/components/journalingFormDb.tsx

 {status === 'authenticated' && <GeneratePostPromptButtonDB />}
 ------

Plan is very simple. I will completely split the logic of using locaStorage data for non-auth users and using DB for authorized users and make it for all my features.



### Phase 1: Project Setup & UI (3 Hours)

    - A simple, clean form for journal entries. The form should have clear sections based on the initial prompts (e.g., "What went well this day?", "What did I learn?", "What would I do differently?").
    - A "Generate Post Prompt" button.
